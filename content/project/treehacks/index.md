The inspiration behind building this app was to address the critical issue of medical errors in healthcare. According to a study by Johns Hopkins, medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States, after heart disease and cancer, with an estimated 250,000 deaths per year. These errors can occur due to various factors, including miscommunication and lack of complete patient information. Doctors have to go through piles of notes and patient histories, leading to time-consuming processes and increased risk of medical errors. By streamlining the conversation between doctors and patients and providing a clear overview of the patient's health status other relevant diagnosis information, Health Story aims to reduce the risk of medical errors and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Our mission is to make health management more efficient, effective, and safe for both doctors and patients.
