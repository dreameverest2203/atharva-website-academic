The objective of this project was to build an AI-assisted system that can aid a 911 operator. This helps in reducing the operator's workload and saving crucial time which otherwise would go to waste in collecting details. Our system extracts entities such as address/type of the emergency, nearest hospital/fire-station in real-time from the audio transcript.
