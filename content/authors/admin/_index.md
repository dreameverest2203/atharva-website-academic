Hello there! I am a second-year Master's student at Stanford University's Institute of Computational and Mathematical Engineering. I am broadly interested in Artificial Intelligence, specifically in building systems that can reliably and robustly learn to reason.

In 2022, I spent a wonderful summer interning as an Applied Scientist at Amazon where I worked on Graph Representation Learning to refine the knowledge graph at the backend of the Amazon Catalogue System. In my first year at Stanford, I worked on a wide variety of projects, ranging from Deep Generative Models, to domain-agnostic Self-Supervised Learning and Natural Language Processing.  

Before joining Stanford, I worked as a Quantitative Researcher at a high-frequency trading firm in India where I contributed to the automation and backtesting of trading strategies using Statistical Machine Learning. In 2020, I graduated with a B.Tech after spending 4 wonderful years as an undergraduate at IIT Guwahati, majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science.
